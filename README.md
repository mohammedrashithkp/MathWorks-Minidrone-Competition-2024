# MathWorks Minidrone Competition 2024

This repository contains all the assets developed and used by our team to participate in the MathWorks Minidrone Competition 2024. We were honored to be among the finalists, though we did not secure a win.
We hope that by sharing our approach and lessons learned, future participants can benefit and build upon our work.

🎯 How We Will Re-approach the Competition

If we were to participate again, our improvements would focus on:

1. Integration of Yaw Control

Enhance maneuverability by implementing accurate yaw angle stabilization and control.



2. Stateflow Integration

Use Stateflow for modeling decision logic and improving robustness of mission planning and emergency handling.



3. Offline Testing on Hardware

Purchase a Parrot Minidrone to conduct extensive offline tests and validate performance in real-world conditions.

# MathWorks Minidrone Competition 2024
This repository contains all the assets developed and used by our team to participate in the MathWorks Minidrone Competition 2024. We were honored to be among the finalists, though we did not secure a win.
We hope that by sharing our approach and lessons learned, future participants can benefit and build upon our work.

##  Repository Contents

- Simulink models

- Controller algorithms

- Test scripts

- Documentation

##  Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammedrashithkp/MathWorks-Minidrone-Competition-2024.git
```

2. Open the project
- Launch MATLAB.

- Navigate to the cloned folder.

- Open the project file MinidroneCompetition.prj

3. Run the main simulation by clicking run button in simulink

##  How We Will Re-approach the Competition

If we were to participate again, our improvements would focus on:

1. Integration of Yaw Control
Enhance maneuverability by implementing accurate yaw angle stabilization and control.

2. Stateflow Integration
Use Stateflow for modeling decision logic and improving robustness of mission planning and emergency handling.

3. Offline Testing on Hardware
Purchase a Parrot Minidrone to conduct extensive offline tests and validate performance in real-world conditions.
